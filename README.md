# Spelunky

This is my open source Unity fan project of the original Spelunky Classic game made by Derek Yu. I'm not calling it a remake because I have no intention of remaking the game 1:1, nor have I so far taken a single line of code from the actual GameMaker source files. I'm writing all the code myself and I'm making the game how I want it to be in a way that makes sense to me, adding and tweaking features where I see fit along the way. And where I'm using Spelunky as a source of inspiration I'm mainly using the Steam/Xbox 360 remake of the original rather than the original as I feel it plays a lot better than the original, for obvious reasons.

If you want to read more about the original game or take a look at the orginal GameMaker source files for yourself, it's all available here:

I'd love it if people contributed with issues and pull requests. One of my primary goals with this project is to increase my programming knowledge, and a great way of achieving that would be if people improved on the things I've made or told me why they're not working or how they could be improved. It would also be amazing to see this project grow faster than I myself am able to.
